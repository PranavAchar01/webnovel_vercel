"""Simple search utilities for the webnovel service.

This module implements a naÃ¯ve search across the SQLite database when Whoosh
is not available.  It scans all novels, scores them based on the presence
of query terms in different fields, and returns a list of novel IDs ordered
by relevance.  It also filters by audio availability if requested.
